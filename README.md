# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Using SQL 📊

Welcome to the **Healthcare Data Analysis** project! In this project, we perform a detailed analysis of hospital data using **SQL**, aiming to extract meaningful insights that can help improve decision-making in the healthcare industry.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- Extract data from multiple sources (CSV, Excel, Databases)  
- Clean and transform the data for consistency and reliability  
- Load the data into a SQL database for analysis  
- Perform complex SQL queries to analyze patient, treatment, and hospital data  
- Visualize insights that can drive better healthcare strategies
