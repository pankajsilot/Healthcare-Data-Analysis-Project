🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Using SQL 📊
Welcome to the Healthcare Data Analysis project! In this project, we perform a detailed analysis of hospital data using SQL, aiming to extract meaningful insights that can help improve decision-making in the healthcare industry.

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:

Extract data from multiple sources (CSV, Excel, Databases)

Clean and transform the data for consistency and reliability

Load the data into a SQL database for analysis

Perform complex SQL queries to analyze patient, treatment, and hospital data

Visualize insights that can drive better healthcare strategies

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
🐘 SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)

📁 CSV & Excel Files

🧹 Data Cleaning & ETL Process

🧮 Aggregate Functions, Joins, Subqueries, CTEs

📄 PDF Report for final analysis insights
